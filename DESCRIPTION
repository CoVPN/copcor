Description: Correlates of protection (CoP) and correlates of risk (CoR) study the immune biomarkers associated with an infectious disease outcome, e.g. COVID or HIV-1 infection. This package contains shared functions for analyzing CoP and CoR, including bootstrapping procedures, competing risk estimation, and bootstrapping marginalized risks.
